/*
Binary Search
Initialize low as the median element and high as the maximum element in the array.
While low is less than high:
  Calculate mid as the average of low and high.
If itâ€™s possible to make the median at least mid by adding k or fewer numbers, set low to mid + 1.
Otherwise, set high to mid.
Return low - 1 as the maximum possible median.

O(n logm) where n is size of array and m is max possible median.
